[Industrial Predictive Maintenance System](https://industrial-predictive-maintenance-system-c739vp4mtmrebnnkgh8wh.streamlit.app/)

---

## 📌 Overview

Industrial equipment failures can cause significant downtime, maintenance costs, and production losses. This project leverages Machine Learning to predict machine failures before they occur, enabling proactive maintenance planning and reducing unexpected breakdowns.

The system analyzes key machine operating parameters such as temperature, rotational speed, torque, and tool wear to determine the likelihood of machine failure and provide actionable maintenance recommendations.

This project demonstrates an end-to-end Machine Learning workflow including data preprocessing, model training, explainable AI, dashboard development, and cloud deployment.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Predict machine failures using Machine Learning.
* Provide failure probability and risk assessment.
* Explain predictions using Explainable AI (SHAP).
* Generate maintenance recommendations.
* Visualize operational insights through interactive dashboards.
* Support proactive maintenance decision-making.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

### Data Collection

AI4I Predictive Maintenance Dataset

### Data Preprocessing

* Missing value analysis
* Feature engineering
* Label encoding
* Feature scaling
* Train-test splitting

### Model Training

Multiple models were evaluated:

* Logistic Regression
* Decision Tree
* Random Forest
* Gradient Boosting
* Extra Trees Classifier

### Model Selection

Random Forest was selected based on overall predictive performance and interpretability. Random Forest models are commonly used in predictive maintenance applications because they effectively capture relationships among operational sensor variables and machine failures.
